This is meant to be a OAuth2 Google Latitude API client written in C#.

It uses DotNetOpenAuth and mainly is made out of the very few examples given for the google APIs.

There are several problems right now - but maybe they get caught in the next days while I make this
available as open source software.

Play with it!
